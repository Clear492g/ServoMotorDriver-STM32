Servo motors are small motors unlike size they possess greater torque and can move heavy loads. Their small size possessing high torque made them popular among toy makers. Many toys that are around us contains servo motors in them along with dc motors. Normally servo motors in ideal state consumes little power but during load moving power shoots off and servos start consuming greater amount of current.
Servo motors works on pwm(pulse width modulated) signals. They have an arm/armature which rotates when sufficient voltage, current and pwm signal is applied to motor. When arm rotates it moves every thing that comes in its ways.  
Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is used for controlling the amplitude of digital signals in order to control devices and applications requiring power or electricity.
Variable PWM signal is used for controlling the speed of DC motors/Fans. It is also used in AC Light Dimmer. PWM solar chargers also work on variable PWM signal. Servo Motors angle and direction is also controlled with the PWM signal.
A potentiometer is also interfaced to vary the position of the servo motorâ€™s shaft, and an LCD to display the angle value
Most of the dc servo motors require 50 Hz frequency for operation with variable duty cycle.

Servo duty cycle and Frequency Requirement:

At period 20 milli seconds and duty cycle 2 milli seconds servo motor arm moves to 180 degree. At duty cycle 1.5 milli seconds arm moves to 90 degree and at duty cycle 1 milli seconds arm rotates to 0 degree.
